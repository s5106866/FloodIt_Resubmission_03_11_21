## Module lib
This is the base game code that is provided to help implement the game. It provides some structure
as needed for Testing but leaves you to do your own implementation. You are not expected to change 
this code, and don't need to to be able to allow the tests to still pass.

The tests in this module are there only for your information. You can very well ignore them.
